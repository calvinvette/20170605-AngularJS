Friday!

Rest of today:
Finishing Single Page Applications Lab (13

Routing

Upcoming additional materials (all as time allows)
Debugging
Yo/Grunt/Gulp/Bower... WebPack
Angular 4.x
JBoss Forge
Customer Directives

Let me know if you'd prefer a different order or other relevant subjects.


Everyone's still working on the labs, and some folks had urgent issues that
are taking precedence.

Continue working up through Lab 13 (Single Page Applications)
with a break until 11:45.

We'll pause regardless at noon to cover Routes and some of the additional material
We can always set the afternoon to be a work-at-your-own-pace lab.
I want to make sure the folks who are putting out fires get the material.
