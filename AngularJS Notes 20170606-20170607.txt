Lab 5 (Views) + Lunch until 2:30

The old solution is still available at:

https://github.com/calvinvette/20170213-AngularJS

The new solution is available at:

https://github.com/calvinvette/20170605-AngularJS

It features a double-click to edit quantity feature. 
Check out the new solution to see how it's done.


(I'll be here and muted for most of the time, so
feel free to ask questions. If I don't respond right away,
ask in chat and I'll respond when I get back.)






Assuming package.json is in your top-level folder...

	npm install --save bootstrap

will download bootstrap and update your package.json.





Exercise 6 for now.

A working solution is up in the "new" solution set as well as
the old.

When you're done with the lab or ready to move on, send
me a private message in the chat window so I know when 
everyone is ready.

We're still working on Exercise 9... 

This is an exercise worth taking our time on.

Exercise 10...

Make sure you start the MongoD server

	mongod

	or 
	mkdir MyDataDir
	mongod --dbpath MyDataDir

Populate it if necessary (see setup guide)

The Express server is from the clone of Rap's GitHub directory - 
Clone it if you haven't yet:

	git clone https://github.com/rapPayne/AngularJSLabs/

Start the northwind server

	node northwind.js


If you're using a separate directory for dev like I was,
make sure you copy over "app" and the contents of your "node_modules"
into the northwind folders...
